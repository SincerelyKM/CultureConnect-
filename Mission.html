        Our mission is to promote the Culture in Caribbean Countries by helping Students learn more about heritage sites in their country. This website helps them to find heritage that they may not know exist in their country and in turn learn more about the culture. 
        Students can also contribute to the Community Tab and help others learn more about their Culture.
